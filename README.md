1. Live Streaming & Video Chat
TANGOâ€™s core functionality revolves around live streaming and video chat. Users can broadcast their own content or watch others in real time. The platform supports high-quality video streaming with adjustable settings for different internet speeds. Video chat rooms allow multiple participants to join, making it ideal for group discussions, virtual hangouts, or collaborative broadcasts.

2. Fan Clubs & Subscriptions
To help creators build loyal communities, TANGO introduced Fan Clubs, a subscription-based model where followers can pay a monthly fee (using coins or real money) to access exclusive content. Benefits may include:

Special badges and recognition in chats

Members-only live streams

Early access to new content

Personalized interactions with the creator

This system provides a steady income stream for broadcasters while rewarding their most dedicated fans.

3. Virtual Gifting & Tipping
The virtual gifting system is a major driver of engagement on TANGO. Viewers can send animated gifts that appear on-screen during live streams, creating a fun and interactive experience. Popular gifts often trigger special effects, enhancing the entertainment value. Additionally, TANGO has introduced a direct tipping feature, allowing fans to send instant monetary support without needing to exchange coins first.

4. Multi-Guest Live Rooms
A recent update allows hosts to invite multiple guests into their live streams, turning broadcasts into dynamic group discussions. This is particularly useful for Q&A sessions, interviews, or collaborative gaming streams. The feature supports up to several participants simultaneously, depending on the streamerâ€™s settings.

5. AR Filters & Effects
TANGO has integrated augmented reality (AR) filters and beauty effects to make live streams more visually appealing. Users can apply face-altering filters, backgrounds, and special effects in real time, adding a creative touch to their broadcasts.

6. Cross-Platform Compatibility
TANGO is available on both mobile (iOS and Android) and PC, with seamless synchronization between devices. Users can start a stream on their phone and switch to desktop without interruption. The PC version offers additional customization, such as resizable windows and advanced streaming settings for professional creators.

7. Discoverability & Recommendations
TANGOâ€™s algorithm suggests live streams based on user preferences, watch history, and trending topics. The "Explore" section highlights popular broadcasts, new creators, and themed events, helping users find content that matches their interests.

8. Safety & Moderation Tools
To maintain a positive environment, TANGO employs AI-powered moderation to detect and block inappropriate content. Users can report violations, block harassers, and enable privacy settings to control who interacts with them. The platform also offers two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.
 


Available on both mobile devices and PCs, Tango has garnered positive reviews for its innovative features, seamless user experience, and ability to foster a global community.
